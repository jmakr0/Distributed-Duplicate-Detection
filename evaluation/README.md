# TODO

## plot
- We provide the JupyterNotebooks (`cpu-usage`and `scaleout`) that were used to generate the plots for our paper and 
can be used to further explore the collected data.   

- The log data that were generated as the result of our experiments are transformed to 
a single data object by a python script (`extract.py`).
 Ta access teh data the `zip` has to be extracted and in case that teh path chnaged it has to be adjusted in the notebooks.
